# 21 and Over

## Project Description

An **Age Verification Popup (Age-Gate)** in which a user must indicate that they are 21 or older to access the contents on the website. Googlebots should still be able to read the first page for SEO. If a user is under 21 they will be redirected to a popup indicating that they cannot view the content on the page. If a user is 21 or older the age-gate will be hidden on the homepage. Cookies have been used so that a return user does not have to verify if they are 21 or older. Learn more at [w3schools for Cookies](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp).

## Discussions
1. Google will begin to ban 3rd party cookies in 2023. Learn more straight from the source [blog.google](https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/). The cookies in this project are not considered 3rd Party tracking for targeting ads.

2. [Window.prompt](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp) cannot be styled using CSS so it was not used in this project.

3. [Comparison Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) are a great way to take this a step further if you wish to have users enter their exact birthday or age using a form.
